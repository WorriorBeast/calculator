# calculator

I'm sure everyone knows what a calculator is. We've all had to use one at one point during our life. This will be 
a simple calculator. No fancy calculations. Just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Objectives:

1. Add display for the result
2. Add the following buttons: 
    a. +
    b. -
    c. *
    d. /
    e. =
    f. button for each digit
    g. A/C
3. Make each operation calculate properly
4. Store the display value to use in next operation
5. A/C button will wipe all information stored
6. Round long decimals so they don't overflow the result screen
7. Don't allow user to divide a number by 0

Optional Objectives:

1. Add decimal point button
2. Allow user to click the decimal button once per number
3. Backspace button in case user enters wrong number
4. Add keyboard support

Will most definitely do the optional objectives as well.
